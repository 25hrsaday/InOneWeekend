                                    **Chapter 11: Defocus Blur**

Now our final feature: defocus blur. Note, all photographers will call it “depth of field” so be
aware of only using “defocus blur” among friends.

The reason we defocus blur in real cameras is because they need a big hole (rather than just a
pinhole) to gather light. This would defocus everything, but if we stick a lens in the hole, there
will be a certain distance where everything is in focus. The distance to that plane where things
are in focus is controlled by the distance between the lens and the film/sensor. That is why you
see the lens move relative to the camera when you change what is in focus (that may happen in
your phone camera too, but the sensor moves). The “aperture” is a hole to control how big the
lens is effectively. For a real camera, if you need more light you make the aperture bigger, and
will get more defocus blur. For our virtual camera, we can have a perfect sensor and never
need more light, so we only have an aperture when we want defocus blur.

A real camera has a compound lens that is complicated. For our code we could simulate the
order: sensor, then lens, then aperture, and figure out where to send the rays and flip the
image once computed (the image is projected upside down on the film). Graphics people
usually use a thin lens approximation.

We also don’t need to simulate any of the inside of the camera. For the purposes of rendering
an image outside the camera, that would be unnecessary complexity. Instead I usually start rays
from the surface of the lens, and send them toward a virtual film plane, by finding the projection
of the film on the plane that is in focus (at the distance focus_dist).

For that we just need to have the ray origins be on a disk around lookfrom rather than from a
point:

    {CODE}

Using a big aperture:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C
    {CODE}
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We get:
