Cameras, like dielectrics, are a pain to debug. So I always develop mine incrementally. First,
let’s allow an adjustable field of view (fov). This is the angle you see through the portal. Since
our image is not square, the fov is different horizontally and vertically. I always use vertical fov. I
also usually specify it in degrees and change to radians inside a constructor -- a matter of
personal taste.

I first keep the rays coming from the origin and heading to the z=-1 plane. We could make it the
z=-2 plane, or whatever, as long as we made h a ratio to that distance. Here is our setup:

This implies h = tan(theta/2). Our camera now becomes:

{CODE}

With calling it camera cam(90, float(nx)/float(ny)) and these spheres:

{CODE}

gives:

To get an arbitrary viewpoint, let’s first name the points we care about. We’ll call the position
where we place the camera lookfrom, and the point we look at lookat. (Later, if you want, you
could define a direction to look in instead of a point to look at.)

We also need a way to specify the roll, or sideways tilt, of the camera; the rotation around the
lookat-lookfrom axis. Another way to think about it is even if you keep lookfrom and lookat
constant, you can still rotate your head around your nose. What we need is a way to specify an
up vector for the camera. Notice we already we already have a plane that the up vector should
be in, the plane orthogonal to the view direction.

We can actually use any up vector we want, and simply project it onto this plane to get an up
vector for the camera. I use the common convention of naming a “view up” (vup) vector. A
couple of cross products, and we now have a complete orthonormal basis (u,v,w) to describe
our camera’s orientation.

Remember that vup, v, and w are all in the same plane. Note that, like before when our fixed
camera faced -Z, our arbitrary view camera faces -w. And keep in mind that we can -- but we
don’t have to -- use world up (0,1,0) to specify vup. This is convenient and will naturally keep
your camera horizontally level until you decide to experiment with crazy camera angles.

{CODE}

This allows us to change the viewpoint:

{CODE}

to get:

And we can change field of view to get:
