                        **Chapter 5: Surface normals and multiple objects**

First, let’s get ourselves a surface normal so we can shade. This is a vector that is perpendicular
to the surface, and by convention, points out. One design decision is whether these normals
(again by convention) are unit length. That is convenient for shading so I will say yes, but I won’t
enforce that in the code. This could allow subtle bugs, so be aware this is personal preference
as are most design decisions like that. For a sphere, the normal is in the direction of the hitpoint
minus the center:

On the earth, this implies that the vector from the earth’s center to you points straight up. Let’s
throw that into the code now, and shade it. We don’t have any lights or anything yet, so let’s just
visualize the normals with a color map. A common trick used for visualizing normals (because
it’s easy and somewhat intuitive to assume N is a unit length vector– so each component is
between -1 and 1) is to map each component to the interval from 0 to 1, and then map x/y/z to
r/g/b. For the normal we need the hit point, not just whether we hit or not. Let’s assume the
closest hit point (smallest t). These changes in the code let us compute and visualize N:

{CODE}

And that yields this picture:

Now, how about several spheres? While it is tempting to have an array of spheres, a very clean
solution is the make an “abstract class” for anything a ray might hit and make both a sphere and
a list of spheres just something you can hit. What that class should be called is something of a
quandary-- calling it an “object” would be good if not for “object oriented” programming.
“Surface” is often used, with the weakness being maybe we will want volumes. “Hitable”
emphasizes the member function that unites them. I don’t love any of these but I will go with
“hitable”.

This hitable abstract class will have a hit function that takes in a ray. Most ray tracers have
found it convenient to add a valid interval for hits tmin to tmax, so the hit only “counts” if tmin < t
< tmax. For the initial rays this is positive t, but as we will see, it can help some details in the
code to have an interval tmin to tmax. One design question is whether to do things like compute
the normal if we hit something; we might end up hitting something closer as we do our search,
and we will only need the normal of the closest thing. I will go with the simple solution and
compute a bundle of stuff I will store in some structure. I know we’ll want motion blur at some
point, so I’ll add a time input variable. Here’s the abstract class:

{CODE}

And here’s the sphere (note that I eliminated a bunch of redundant 2’s that cancel each other out):

{CODE}

And a list of objects:

{CODE}

And the new main:

{CODE}

This yields a picture that is really just a visualization of where the spheres are along with their
surface normal. This is often a great way to look at your model for flaws and characteristics.
