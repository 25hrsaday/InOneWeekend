Chapter 6: Antialiasing
When a real camera takes a picture, there are usually no jaggies along edges because the edge
pixels are a blend of some foreground and some background. We can get the same effect by
averaging a bunch of samples inside each pixel. We will not bother with stratification, which is
controversial but is usual for my programs. For some ray tracers it is critical, but the kind of
general one we are writing doesn’t benefit very much from it and it makes the code uglier. We
abstract the camera class a bit so we can make a cooler camera later.
One thing we need is a random number generator that returns real random numbers. C++ did
not traditionally have a standard random number generator but most systems have drand48()
tucked away someplace and that is what I use here. However, newer versions of C++ have
addressed this issue with the <random> header (if imperfectly according to some experts).
Whatever your infrastructure, find a function that returns a canonical random number which by
convention returns random real in the range 0 <= ran < 1. The “less than” before the 1 is
important as we will sometimes take advantage of that.
For a given pixel we have several samples within that pixel and send rays through each of the
samples. The colors of these rays are then averaged:
Putting that all together yields a camera class encapsulating our simple axis-aligned camera
from before:
Main is also changed:
Zooming into the image that is produced, the big change is in edge pixels that are part
background and part foreground:
