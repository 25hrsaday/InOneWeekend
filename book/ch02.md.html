                                   **Chapter 2: The vec3 Class**

Almost all graphics programs have some class(es) for storing geometric vectors and colors. In many
systems these vectors are 4D (3D plus a homogeneous coordinate for geometry, and RGB plus an alpha
transparency channel for colors). For our purposes, three coordinates suffices. We’ll use the same
class vec3 for colors, locations, directions, offsets, whatever. Some people don’t like this because
it doesn’t prevent you from doing something silly, like adding a color to a location. They have a
good point, but we’re going to always take the “less code” route when not obviously wrong.

Here’s the top part of my vec3 class:

{CODE}

I use floats here, but in some ray tracers I have used doubles. Neither is correct-- follow your
own tastes. Everything is in the header file, and later on in the file are lots of vector operations:

{CODE}

Now we can change our main to use this:

{CODE}
